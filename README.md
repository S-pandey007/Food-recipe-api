# Recipe Search Application

## Overview
The Recipe Search Application is a web-based application that allows users to search for recipes by meal names. It fetches data from an external API (TheMealDB) and displays recipes dynamically, offering users detailed information about each recipe. The app also includes features like smooth animations, a modal to view recipe details, and a user-friendly interface for an enhanced experience.

## Features
- **Search Recipes**: Enter a meal name to search for relevant recipes.
- **View Recipe Details**: Click on a "View Recipe" button to view more detailed information about the recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work across different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animations**: Recipe items appear with animations powered by GSAP, including sliding and fade-in effects.
- **Modal Window**: View detailed recipe information in a modal window that can be closed by clicking the close button.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic content and fetches data from TheMealDB API.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Used for animating recipe items with smooth transitions.
- **TheMealDB API**: An external API used to fetch recipe data based on user input.

## Installation

To get the Recipe Search Application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-search-application.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd recipe-search-application
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser:
   - You can either open the file directly or use a live server extension in your editor (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension) for live preview.

## Usage

1. **Search for Recipes**:
   - Enter the name of a meal or dish in the input field and click the search icon.
   - The app will display recipe cards based on the search query, each showing the meal image and name.

2. **View Recipe Details**:
   - Click on the "View Recipe" button for any recipe to open a modal with detailed information about the recipe, including ingredients and preparation instructions.

3. **Close Recipe Cards**:
   - Each recipe card has a close button that allows you to hide it from the list.

## Code Explanation

### Fetch Recipe Function
```javascript
async function fetchRecipe(para) {
    let recipe;
    await fetch(`https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=${para}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        recipe = data;
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
    return recipe;
}
```
This function fetches recipe data from TheMealDB API based on the user input and returns the recipe data in JSON format.

### Creating Recipe Cards
```javascript
function createRecipeDiv(recipe) {
    let data_item_div = document.createElement("div");
    data_item_div.setAttribute("class", "data-item");
    // Creating and appending image, title, and view button
}
```
This function creates a recipe card dynamically by adding the meal image, title, and a "View Recipe" button for each recipe.

### GSAP Animations
```javascript
gsap.from(".data-item", {
    y: 50,
    opacity: 0,
    duration: 0.5,
    stagger: 0.3
});
```
This snippet animates the recipe items with GSAP. Each item slides in from below and fades in with a slight stagger effect.

### Handling Modal
```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.querySelector('.view-recipe-data').style.display = 'block';
});
```
This code snippet opens the modal displaying detailed information about the selected recipe when the "View Recipe" button is clicked.

## Challenges Faced
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Managing asynchronous API calls and ensuring the recipes display after fetching was crucial. This was handled using `async/await`.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Making sure the recipe cards look good on all screen sizes required implementing media queries in the CSS.
- **Modal Management**: Initially, there was some confusion around handling multiple modals, but this was resolved by dynamically updating the modal content.

## Future Improvements
- **Pagination**: Add pagination for large search results to avoid overloading the page.
- **Advanced Search Filters**: Include more filters such as category or ingredient to narrow down search results.
- **User Authentication**: Add functionality for users to save their favorite recipes.
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly messages in case of errors, such as when no recipes are found.
